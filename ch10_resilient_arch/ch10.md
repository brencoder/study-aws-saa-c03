# Chapter 10 - Resilient Architectures

## Messaging and queueing

Tightly coupled - synchronous. Monolithic. If a single component fails, other components or even the entire application also fail.

Loosely coupled - asynchronous. Distributed. If a single component fails, the other components continue to work because they communication with each other via a third-party.

SQS:
* Uses "queues" in a producer-consumer model.
* There is a party at each end of the queue.
* A queue has a single direction, so there is a producer and consumer.
* The producer puts messages on the queue and the consumer reads messages from the queue.
* No messages are lost. SQS guarantees this.

SNS:
* Uses "topics" in a publish-subscribe model.
* You send or publish a message to a topic, and the message will "fan-out" to all subscribers or endpoints in a single go. It's like multi-cast. 
* Subscribers could be SQS queues, Lambda functions, HTTPS web hooks or even users' mobile push (app notification), SMS and email.
