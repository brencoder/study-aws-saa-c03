## Directing traffic with Elastic Load Balancing

It's a regional construct

You are charged for each hour or partial hour that an ELB is running, plus standard AWS data transfer charges, and usually also the number of "load balancer capacity units" used by the load balancer.

Types:
* Application Load Balancer
* Network Load Balancer
* Gateway Load Balancer
* Classic Load Balancer
